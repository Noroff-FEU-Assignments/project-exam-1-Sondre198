## Description

Taste Tales is a food blog that will dynamically update itself as new dishes and recipes are added in the database.

They will also be able to view every blog post when they click on "All posts", and this page will keep adding more recipes automatically when new recipes are added to the database. Clicking on any recipe will bring the user to the recipe page, and this site is built dynamically using Javascript based on the recipe you clicked on.
